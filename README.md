# Dynamic-Matrices-Multiplication
Dynamic Matrices Multiplication in C, second year second semester's second Algorithms project (partial)

Modular program in C language that handles the multiplication problem of a series of matrices using dynamic programming.  

#### Input:
1) Number of matrices - **n**
2) The dimensional vector of the matrices (This vector will be represented by a dynamic array)

#### Output:
1) Table **m** (or **T**)
2) Table **s** (or **R**)
3) Multiplication of the matrices with full brackets
